# 🧪 Code Lab – Language Learning Playground

Welcome to my chaotic-yet-sexy multi-language lab.  
This repo is for exploring how programming languages work under the hood, from high-level scripting to low-level metal-chomping assembly.

Each folder here is a sandbox for a different language, containing notes, mini-projects, scratch files, and various brain dumps.

## 🗂 Folder Structure

| Language   | Purpose                                     |
|------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `python/`  | Scripts, side projects, quick automation.   |
| `nodejs/`  | JS + NPM packages, CLI tools, server stuff. |
| `rust/`    | `cargo` projects and systems exploration.   |
| `go/`      | `go mod` based projects, concurrency fun.   |
| `lua/`     | Neovim configs, script testing, plugin dev. |
| `zig/`     | Manual memory flex and low-level stuff.     |
| `haskell/` | Pure FP, monads, and existential dread.     |
| `bash/`    | Shell scripting and Linux tooling.          |
| `zsh/`     | Like bash, but with a nose ring.            |
| `c/`       | Manual memory madness and segfaults.        |
| `cpp/`     | OOP, templates, and way too much syntax.    |
| `assembly/`| NASM, x86, ARM: the sauce beneath the sauce.|

## 📝 Notes

Each language has a `notes.md` inside with:
- Syntax highlights
- Learning links
- Gotchas
- My personal suffering logs

---

## 🧠 Goal

Understand:
- Core syntax, types, and control flow of each language.
- Their memory models, performance characteristics, and runtime behavior.
- What makes them tick and what makes them trash (or treasure).

---

## ⚙ Tools Used

- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)
- [Hyprland](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland) tiling goodness
- `kickstart.nvim` for editor config
- Linux, because Windows is for BIOS updates
